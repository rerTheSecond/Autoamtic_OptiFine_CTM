# Automatic CTM
A script that makes all 47 textures for OptiFine's Connected Texture Module.

**Input:**
- An image with full a border around it. (outline.png)
- An image without any border. (texture.png)

After you have these images in the same folder as the script run it and a folder with the name "result"
should be created. Inside all 47 images(0-46) will be found.

It does support animated textures with a height n times its width. Enter the amount of tiles in one image
after the script prompts you to do so.

The connected_tile.txt file just stores the data needed to draw the outline properly.
